# Bidomain Model

Project conducted during the Scientific Computing course at TU Berlin.


The Bidomain equations focus on modelling the propagation of electrical potential waves in the myocardium.
Implementation following the paper from Ethier and Bourgault. We used the VoronoiFVM.jl package to solve the problem.


## Use
